    <hr>
    <p>Hello! My name is Mark, and I am passionate about Full-Stack development as well as C++ programming. I enjoy delving into different technologies related to these fields, constantly exploring new tools and techniques to broaden my expertise. Applying my skills, I work on developing applications that broaden my knowledge within the computer science field. I thrive on making ideas a reality by combining knowledge and creativity, whether I'm creating responsive websites, coding desktop applications or simply learning a new technology. I have been coding since the age of nine, which has allowed me to build a strong foundation in programming logic and problem-solving from an early age. Additionally, I am proficient in using Linux as my primary development environment, appreciating its freedom that enhance my workflow and support my exploration of various programming languages and technologies.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I usually code in C++ and Javascript, and I am currently learning more about Backend and Typescript!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Currently, I am doing multiple things, but mainly I am working on Smaui and Mengine. Check out my GitHub on the Contacts page.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Feel free to reach out to me through the contact page if you have any questions or just want to chat!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Online you might encounter me using either Cyno or Bennet profile pictures / account themes.</p>
